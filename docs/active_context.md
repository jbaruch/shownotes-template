# Active Context - Conference Talk Show Notes Platform

## Current Phase: Analysis (Phase 1)

**Status**: Completing Analysis Phase
**Start Date**: 2025-08-20
**Phase Goal**: Analyze requirements, define boundaries, document assumptions

## Completed Analysis Tasks

### ✅ Requirements Analysis
- Analyzed software definition document

- Documented success metrics and business goals
- Defined primary and secondary user personas

### ✅ Project Boundaries Definition
- **In Scope**: Static site generation, mobile-first design, QR code access, email notifications, feedback forms
- **Out of Scope**: Conference management system, payment processing, complex user authentication, real-time features
- **MVP Boundaries**: Basic talk pages, resource access, GitHub-based content management

### ✅ Architecture Documentation
- Defined Static Site + Serverless architecture pattern
- Identified GitHub Pages + Jekyll as core technology choice
- Planned serverless integration points for dynamic features
- Documented scalability and security approaches

### ✅ Technical Context Establishment
- Technology stack selection and rationale
- Integration requirements with external services
- Performance and browser support requirements
- Development environment specifications

### ✅ Assumptions Documentation
- Platform selection assumptions (Jekyll, GitHub Pages)
- Development workflow assumptions (GitHub-based content management)
- Performance assumptions (conference traffic patterns, mobile-first)
- Security and privacy assumptions (public content, static site security)

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Decisions
1. **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll (GitHub Pages native support)
2. **Hosting Platform**: GitHub Pages (cost-effective, reliable)
3. **Content Format**: Markdown + YAML frontmatter
4. **Build System**: GitHub Actions CI/CD
5. **Dynamic Features**: Serverless functions for email/forms

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Primary optimization for mobile devices
2. **CDN-First Delivery**: Leverage GitHub Pages built-in CDN
3. **Git-Based Workflow**: Version controlled content management
4. **Modular Features**: Plugin-like architecture for extensibility
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality without JavaScript

### Scope Decisions
1. **MVP Focus**: Talk pages with resource access
2. **Phased Rollout**: Email notifications and feedback in Phase 2
3. **Multi-Conference**: Design for eventual multi-tenancy
4. **White-Label Support**: Conference customization capabilities
5. **Privacy-First**: GDPR-compliant analytics and data handling

## Current Understanding

### Core Problem
Conference attendees struggle to access talk materials during and after presentations, leading to lost resources and missed connections between speakers and attendees.

### Solution Approach
Provide a mobile-optimized platform accessible via QR codes for quick verification during talks, designed for post-talk resource access, bookmarking, sharing, and return visits when videos are published.

### Success Criteria (Simplified)
- Quick mobile access for verification during talks
- Easy bookmarking and sharing capabilities
- Clear post-talk resource access and navigation
- Simple notification signup for video releases
- Clean URLs optimized for sharing with colleagues

### Traffic Expectations
- **Very Low Volume**: ~100s of visits per shownotes page total
- **Personal Archive**: Individual speaker's talk collection
- **No Scaling Concerns**: GitHub Pages default performance sufficient

## Next Phase Preparation

### Ready for Specification Phase
- Requirements clearly documented
- Architecture patterns established
- Technology choices validated
- Assumptions documented and risks identified

### Phase 2 Prerequisites
- All analysis documentation complete
- Version control established and phase tagged
- No protected file violations occurred
- User approval required before proceeding

## Three-Phase Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP - Simple Shownotes Page
**Goal**: Demonstrate feasibility of the approach
- Single talk page template
- Basic resource display (slides, links)
- Mobile-responsive design
- QR code accessibility
- Minimal viable functionality to prove concept

### Phase 2: Migration - Notist Archive Migration
**Goal**: Migrate existing shownotes archive from noti.st (speaking.jbaru.ch)
- Import existing talk data and resources
- Maintain URL structure for SEO/bookmarks
- Batch content migration tools
- Validate all content transfers correctly

### Phase 3: Full Featured Platform  
**Goal**: Complete conference platform with management features
- Email notification system
- Feedback collection forms
- Talk creation and editing interface
- Template system for reusing talk structures
- Multi-conference support
- Analytics and reporting

## Decisions Made from User Input

### ✅ Technology Stack Confirmed
- **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll (GitHub Pages native)
- **Email Service**: Standard recommendation (SendGrid/Mailgun) for Phase 3
- **Analytics**: Privacy-focused approach (Plausible/Fathom)

### ✅ Development Approach
- **Phase 1 Focus**: Single page proof of concept
- **Migration Priority**: Preserve existing content and URLs
- **Feature Rollout**: Incremental complexity addition

### Phase 1 Scope Refinement
**Current Phase Focus**: MVP - Single shownotes page
- Simplified from original multi-conference vision
- Proof of concept for Jekyll + GitHub Pages approach
- Foundation for Phase 2 migration work

### Technical Validation Needed (Future Phases)
1. Notist data export format and migration approach (Phase 2)
2. URL structure preservation strategy (Phase 2)
3. Serverless function provider selection (Phase 3)
4. Email template design requirements (Phase 3)

## Risk Register

### Risks (Simplified)
1. **Learning Curve**: GitHub/Markdown workflow for content management
   - **Mitigation**: Simple documentation, start with basic editing

2. **Future Feature Complexity**: Adding advanced features later
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 3 approach allows complexity when needed

3. **Migration Complexity**: Notist data import challenges  
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 2 focus, plan import scripts carefully

### Eliminated Risks
- **Performance/Scaling**: Not relevant for ~100s visits per page
- **Complex Infrastructure**: Static site simplicity removes most technical risks
- **High Availability**: GitHub Pages reliability sufficient for personal archive
