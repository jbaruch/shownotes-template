## Abstract

Embark on an exciting journey into the intersection of psychology, software development, and Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE) as we explore how Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman’s groundbreaking work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making can optimize your development practices while conserving cognitive resources.
Discover the impact of System 1 and System 2 thinking on the software development process, and learn to strike the perfect balance between “”fast”” intuitive thinking and “”slow”” deliberative reasoning.
We’ll delve into practical DPE strategies for reducing mental fatigue and minimizing context switches, focusing on techniques like build system performance optimization, test parallelization, AI-powered test selection, and developer productivity observability. By leveraging these best practices, you’ll enhance your and your team’s productivity and maintain focus on high-value tasks.
Whether you’re an experienced developer seeking to boost your performance or a curious newcomer eager to learn about the connections between the human mind, software development, and DPE, this talk is for you. Join us for an exhilarating adventure into the fast and slow worlds of coding, and uncover new ways to maximize your cognitive resources.
