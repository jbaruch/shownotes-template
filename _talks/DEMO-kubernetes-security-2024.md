# Kubernetes Security: The Attacks You're Not Prepared For

Live demo of real attack vectors targeting Kubernetes clusters. From RBAC misconfigurations to supply chain attacks - see how attackers think and how to defend.

## Abstract

Your Kubernetes cluster is probably more vulnerable than you think. In this session, we demonstrate actual attack techniques used in the wild:

- Escaping containers through misconfigurations
- Exploiting overly permissive RBAC
- Supply chain attacks through compromised base images
- Secrets extraction from etcd
- Lateral movement within clusters

For each attack, we show the defense. Walk away with a concrete hardening checklist.
