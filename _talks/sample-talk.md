## Key Takeaways

- Modern JavaScript offers powerful patterns for cleaner code
- Async/await simplifies complex asynchronous operations  
- Functional programming concepts improve code reliability
- Proper tooling setup is essential for team productivity

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of the async/await pattern:

```javascript
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const userData = await response.json();
    return userData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
