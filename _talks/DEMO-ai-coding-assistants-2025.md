Every developer tool company is racing to add AI. But what actually works? This talk cuts through the marketing to show real productivity data and patterns that matter.

## Abstract

GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Amazon Q - the market for AI coding assistants has exploded. Vendors claim 40-55% productivity gains. But the reality is more nuanced.

Based on data from 50+ development teams, this talk examines:
- Which tasks AI assistants actually accelerate
- Where they create more problems than they solve
- The "vibe coding" phenomenon and its risks
- Practical adoption strategies that work

No hype, no fear-mongering - just data-driven insights for engineering leaders making tooling decisions.
