Platform engineering is transforming how organizations approach DevOps. In this talk, we explore the shift from traditional CI/CD pipelines to internal developer platforms and what it means for your team.

## Abstract

The DevOps movement promised to break down silos between development and operations. A decade later, we've learned that tooling alone isn't enough. Platform engineering emerges as the next evolution - treating your internal infrastructure as a product.

This session covers:
- Why CI/CD pipelines became unmaintainable spaghetti
- The platform engineering mindset shift
- Building golden paths without golden cages
- Real-world case studies from enterprises making the transition
